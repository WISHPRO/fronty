# Fronty
Fronty is a boilerplate for starting new front-end projects.

### Why boilerplate?
I explained my opinion on this topic in blog post "[About CSS Frameworks](http://goschevski.com/about-css-frameworks.html)".

### Dependencies
Fronty is using node and gulp to compile css, javascript and to optimize images.
```
$ npm i -g gulp
$ npm i
```

### Compailers
For css fronty is using sass. For javascript fronty is using browserify.

### Structure
Sass code base is giving you only some base mixins, functions and variables **without any UI component**.
